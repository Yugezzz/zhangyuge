        "This mini-project demonstrated combined use of regex and basic NLP preprocessing on a short blog-like text. Regex extracted emails, dates, phones, hashtags, URLs, and numbers; common edge cases were noted (date ambiguity, phone-format variation). Tokenization + lowercasing + stopword removal + Porter stemming produced compact tokens; the top tokens reflected key themes: \"focus\", \"work\", \"task\", \"productivity\". A simple regex+NLP combo extracted (number, following-token) pairs useful for capturing counts tied to nouns (e.g., \"3 main tasks\"). Challenges included ambiguous date formats and approximating nouns without a POS-tagger. Overall the notebook is reproducible and suitable as a baseline for more advanced entity extraction or POS-aware pipelines.\n"
